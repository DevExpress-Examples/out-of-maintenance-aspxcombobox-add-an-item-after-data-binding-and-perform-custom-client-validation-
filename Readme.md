# ASPxComboBox - Add an item after data binding and perform custom client validation


<p>This example shows how to insert an item into the ASPxComboBox ItemCollecton in code behind. The ComboBox is originally bound to an Access data source at design time. In addition, custom client-side validation is performed on the ComboBox every time the validation button is clicked. If the selected items is the first item in the ComboBox (the item that was added after data-bound) validation fails and a message is displayed. </p>
